If it's not running on the latest available version, follow the [firmware upgrading guide](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/firmware-upgrading/) to install the latest version.

## Install development environment

We recommend [Azure IoT Device Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-iot-workbench) extension for Visual Studio Code to develop on the IoT DevKit.

Azure IoT Device Workbench provides an integrated experience to develop IoT solutions. It helps both on device and cloud development using Azure IoT and other services. You can watch this [Channel9 video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/IoT-Workbench-extension-for-VS-Code) to have an overview of what it does.

Follow these steps to prepare the development environment for the IoT DevKit:

1. Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). It provides the necessary toolchain for compiling and uploading Arduino code.

  **Note:** Arduino IDE `1.8.7` has breaking changes, causing board package and library installation failures. It is recommended to that you install version `1.8.6`

   * Windows: Use Windows Installer version
   * macOS: Drag and drop the Arduino into `/Applications`
   * Ubuntu: Unzip it into `$HOME/Downloads/arduino-1.8.5`

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a cross platform source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

3. Look for **Azure IoT Device Workbench** in the extension marketplace and install it.
    ![Install IoT Device Workbench](media/iot-devkit-get-started/install-workbench.png)
    Together with the IoT Device Workbench, other dependent extensions will be installed.

4. Look for **Arduino** in the extension marketplace and install it.

5. Open **File > Preference > Settings** and add following lines to set the configurations for Arduino.

	![Config settings](media/iot-devkit-get-started/iot-workbench-setting.png)

	The [ST-Link/V2](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) is the USB interface that IoT DevKit uses to communicate with your development machine. Follow the platform specific steps to allow the machine access to your device.

	* Windows
	Download and install USB driver from [STMicro](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).

	* macOS
	No driver is required for macOS.

	* Unbutu
  	Run the following in terminal and logout and login for the group change to take effect:

		```bash
		# Copy the default rules. This grants permission to the group 'plugdev'
		sudo cp ~/.arduino15/packages/AZ3166/tools/openocd/0.10.0/linux/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
		sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
		
		# Add yourself to the group 'plugdev'
		# Logout and log back in for the group to take effect
		sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $(whoami)
		```
