The **Azure IoT Device Workbench** <sup>preview</sup> is an extension in Visual Studio Code that provides an integrated environment to code, build, deploy and debug your IoT device project with multiple Azure services supported.

## Device platforms and languages supported

Azure IoT Device Workbench aims to support multiple device platforms and its devices. Currently the following device platforms and languages are supported :

### Embedded Linux

Languages supported: `C / C++`

Devices supported: [Cortex-A series](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-a) devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi, NXP i.MX6) that are running Embedded Linux such as Debian, Ubuntu or Yocto Linux.

### Arduino

Languages supported: `Arduino C`

Devices supported:

- [MXChip IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/iot-devkit)
- [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview)
- [teXXmo IoT button](https://aka.ms/button)

Please help to take the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C7NY7KJ) to let us know extra device platforms and languages you want to have for Device Workbench.

## Installation

### Prerequisite

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with version >= 1.35.1.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Docker CE)

You will need Docker Desktop and Visual Studio Code version with [VS Code Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote) to compile the device code in the [containerized device toolchain](#).

### Install extensions

1. Launch VS Code, in the Extension tab, find and install **"Remote Development"** extension pack. This will enable the VS Code Remote Development.
    ![Extension install Remote Development](./docs/images/remote-dev.png)

2. Then, in the same Extension tab, find and install **"Azure IoT Device Workbench"**.
    ![Extension install Device Workbench](./docs/images/device-workbench.png)

3. Reload the window and make sure all the dependency extensions are correctly installed.

4. Open Docker settings page, enable "Shared Device" so that local environment can access the folders in container.
    ![Shared driver](./docs/images/remote-dev.png)

## Usage

Depending on the device platform you choose, follow the resources below to develop on it.

### Embedded Linux

To simplify the cross compiling toolchain, Azure IoT Device SDK and dependencies setup and configuration, Device Workbench put all these components in the container. All cross-compiling works happen in it. Here is the quick start of using it to develop and compile a simple device app written in C and running on Raspberry Pi to send telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.

### Provision Azure Services

![Provision Azure services](./docs/images/provision.gif)

### Open Examples

![Open samples](./docs/images/example.gif)

#### Note: 
-  When invoking the **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Provision Azure Services...** command with Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, by default, Azure Functions would use the IoT Hub consumer group of `$Default`. To switch to another consumer group, please follow the [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) to create a new consumer group in Azure Portal. Then in IoT project, modify the following setting in **function.json**:
    ```
    "consumerGroup": "[consumer_group_name]"
    ```
-  You may open an existing IoT project after you close it. To do so:
    -  In the menu of **Visual Studio Code**, choose *File -> Open Workspace...* .
    -  In file selection panel, navigate to the folder that contains your project and select *{PROJECT_NAME}.code-project*.

        ![IoT Device Workbench: OpenExisting](docs/pic/openexisting.png)
    -  Click **Open**.
